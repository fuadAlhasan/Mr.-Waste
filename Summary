The use of plastic items for the COVID 19 epidemic has been increased and people are dumping garbage everywhere due to its negligence. The people who live near beaches used to throw masks and other items directly to sea water. As a result, the environment is polluting and reducing human traffic in the protected areas and other forms of wilderness areas. In this situation we find a solution that, MR.WASTE will collect all these used material that is going to pollute sea water. We will purchase those items from consumers and give it to the waste management companies. We are happy to save the environment and create a workplace for the lower income people.
